# PHP code for RabbitMQ tutorials

Here you can find PHP code examples from [RabbitMQ
tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html).

To successfully use the examples you will need a running RabbitMQ server.

## Requirements

### PHP 7.0+

You need `PHP 7.0` and `php-amqplib`. To get these
dependencies on Ubuntu type:

    sudo apt-get install git-core php5-cli


### Composer

Then [install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) per instructions on their site.


### Client Library

Then you can install `php-amqplib` using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

To do that install Composer and add it to your path, then run the following command
inside this project folder:

    composer.phar install
    
Or you can require it to the existing project using a command:

    composer.phar require php-amqplib/php-amqplib
